Thank you for opting in to test this early build of my STRIKER porgram. As of now this is litle more than a proof of
concept but i am working on makeing it better and more intelegent.
If you find a bug or would like to sudgest improvements for the system (this is why you have it) please read the included
"Requested Changes" file inside of the "STRIKER Data" folder

All that is needed for setup is to copy the "STRIKER data" folder onto your desktop and move the shortcut inside of there to
outside of the folder. If the shortcut doesen't work simply make a shortcut to the "STRIKER.BAT" file on your desktop.
